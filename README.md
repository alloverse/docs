# Alloverse

_By Nevyn Bengtsson (nevyn@alloverse.com), started 2018-08-25._

Alloverse is an open platform for collaborative workspaces in 3D.
It’s Gibson style Cyberspace, but for your day-to-day work and play, with your friends and colleagues. It’s a VR and AR platform for creating spaces, and for running real applications within those spaces, together with other people.
